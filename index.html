            Sarah manages her credit cards as tools to earn rewards rather than to build up debt by carefully keeping track of her spending, points and bonus opportunities. 
            She plans her card applications and monitors her accounts closely so she can fund travel experiences without paying interest.

                    <li>Testing new financial apps before relying on them - “If an app is buggy, I’m out.”</li>
                    <li>Trying replacement budgeting or tracking tools - “I tried the Mint replacement (Credit Karma's net worth tool), but it’s clunky.”</li>
                    <li>Evaluating whether financial advice is trustworthy - “If they just say ‘it's awesome,’ I ignore it.”</li>
